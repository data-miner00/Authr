# Cookie Schemes

In this example, we will use multiple cookie authentication scheme to authenticate users.

There will be 3 schemes,

1. `visitor` - Any user that visits without login will be authenticated by this scheme.
1. `local` - Authenticated users
1. `oauth` - OAuth authenticated users

Multiple schemes can be used to identify multiple parts of the system.
